            Fillerama provides dummy text based on popular TV shows, including Futurama, Arrested Development, 
            Doctor Who and more, with the markup on the left and the rendered text on the right for easy copying and pasting:

            "We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Leela's gonna kill me. Eeeee! Now say 'nuclear wessels'! And when we 
             woke up, we had these bodies. I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?"

            Feeling too mainstream and in desperate need of some dummy text? Of course you are. Hipster Ipsum will take your inner hipster to the next level:

            "Est Schlitz shoreditch fashion axe. Messenger bag cupidatat Williamsburg sustainable aliqua, artisan duis pickled pitchfork. Semiotics Banksy ad 
            roof party, jean shorts selvage mollit vero consectetur hashtag before they sold out blue bottle qui nihil aute. Aliquip artisan retro squid ullamco.

            Fillerati is for the more refined linguist, with dummy text from authors such as Herman Melville (Moby Dick) and Lewis Carroll (Alice in Wonderland). 
            The source for the public domain filler text is provided by Project Gutenberg:

            "In connection with this appellative of 'Whalebone whales,' it is of great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be convenient
            in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded upon either his baleen,
            or hump, or fin, or teeth."
